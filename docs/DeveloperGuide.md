## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagramNew.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores a `PersonBook`, `LocationBook` and `VisitBook` for the three types of data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList` of each type which can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Person`, `Location` and `Visit` components are shown in more detail below.

![Structure of Person and Location components](images/PersonLocationClassDiagram.png)
![Structure of the Visit component](images/VisitClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add person

This is a placeholder section for the "Manage data using CSV files section." Please update the link in that section if the header of this
section is changed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add location

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add visit

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Manage Persons, Locations and Visits using Unique Identifiers (Ho Pin Xian)

Person objects have different aspects (including Name, Address, Phone Number, infection status etc) but none of which can
uniquely identify a single Person. Family members may live in the same Address. Common names such as John may belong to multiple
people. Young people without their own phones may be using their house number or a parent's number.
The same can be said for Location objects as well. Hence, unique identifiers are required to uniquely and reliably identify
each Person and Location.

Since VirusTracker manages lists of Person and Location objects, it is necessary for VirusTracker to
uniquely identify the Person and Location involved in a Visit. Unique Identifiers have great significance within VirusTracker
and support many information generating functions and basic Model managing functions. 

An example of how VirusTracker makes use of Unique Identifiers will be shown in the following Add Visit command example.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** Users may add Visits to VirusTracker via Unique Identifiers or Indexes. 
However, we will only be showing the Unique Identifier case in the following example.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Adding Visit using Unique Identifiers

Users may add a Visit from a specified Person to a specified Location on a specified date to the VirusTracker.
Notice how VirusTracker is able to identify the Person and Location involved in the Visit without requiring the user
to key in all properties of the Person and Location.

**Format:** `addVisit idp/PERSON_ID idl/LOCATION_ID d/DATE`

* `PERSON_ID` refers to the ID of the Person making the Visit. A Person with the specified ID must exist in VirusTracker.
* `LOCATION_ID` refers to the ID of the Location where the Visit is at. A Location with the specified ID must exist in VirusTracker.
* `DATE` is the date when the Visit occurred. 

#### Sequence diagram

The sequence diagram below shows how the adding operation works.

![AddVisitUniqueIdentifierSequenceDiagram](images/AddVisitUniqueIdentifierSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Activity diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `addVisit` command.

![AddVisitUniqueIdentifiersActivityDiagram](images/AddVisitUniqueIdentifiersActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

The design considerations below highlight alternative solutions to Unique Identifiers in the management of Persons and Locations within VirusTracker and provides reasons for the choice of implementation.

##### Aspect: User Input Identifiers Vs VirusTracker Created Identifiers
  
* **Alternative 1:** User Input Unique Identifiers.
  * User inputs Unique Identifier during creation of Person and Location objects.
 
* **Alternative 2:** VirusTracker Created Unique Identifiers.
  * VirusTracker creates a Unique Identifier for each Person and Location object upon creation.

For this aspect, we choose to make use of Unique Identifiers provided by the user as opposed to VirusTracker creating Unique Identifiers at the backend.
      
**Rationale**

The target audience of VirusTracker are healthcare officials in charge of managing the response to an infectious pandemic. 
It would thus be reasonable to assume that they have access to the Unique Identifiers given by the State to each Person.
In Singapore's context, this would refer to the NRIC number. Similarly, the same would go for Locations.

VirusTracker overloads functions to take in Unique Identifiers instead of Indexes as input when referring to Locations and Persons.
The benefit of using Unique Identifiers over Indexes is that users do not have to scroll the list to find the Index of the
Person/Location they wish to refer to. We expect that a user whom wants to generate data involving an object, would
already be aware of the state given Unique Identifier of the object. 

If VirusTracker creates the Unique Identifiers, this benefit would be lost since users will need to find the
Unique Identifier provided by the VirusTracker. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting Visit using a specific Index (Shu long)
This feature allows the VirusTracker to delete the certain visit histories easily from the visit book as it may contain
incorrect information that does not contribute to contact tracing and generating the potential list for quarantine.
Hence, implementing this feature is necessary which enables the user to be more flexible in handling the data by 
removing the invalid visit record from the data before adding the updated version.

**Format:** `deleteVisit Index`

* `Index` refers to the Index of the targeted visit inside the displayed visit list. The targeted visit must exist in VirusTracker.

#### Implementation

* The visit that corresponds to the specified Index will be removed from the visit list.

#### Sequence diagram
The sequence diagram below shows how the deleteVisit operation works. Certain utility classes have been omitted for readability.
![DeleteVisitSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteVisitSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `deleteVisit 1` command.
![DeleteVisitActivityDiagram](images/DeleteVisitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration

To specifically remove an invalid visit from the visit list, the index of that targeted visit as shown in the list offers an easy
way to quickly identify which visit the user is referring to, compared to using other fields of that visit information such
as the details of the person, details of the location and details of the location, which requires a lot of input from the user
for the same intended outcome.

### Deleting Visits using a specific date (Shu long)
This feature allows the VirusTracker to delete the outdated visit histories easily from the visit book as certain visit 
records will not contribute to contact tracing and generating the potential list for quarantine. The rationale is that 
the visits record before a time mark, for example 2 months ago, may not help to trace the recent list of contact 
for the new infected cases. Also, considering the number of visits made by all citizens in total, the data file size will be 
unnecessarily large, which not only makes the visit list harder to read, but also for the app slower to process with
the data. Hence, implementing this feature is necessary which enables the user to be more flexible in handling the data by 
removing the outdated visits record from the data.

**Format:** `deleteVisits d/Date`

#### Implementation

* Date is the targeted date set as the benchmark, all the visits that occur before and on the date itself will be deleted from the visit list.

#### Sequence diagram
The sequence diagram below shows how the deleteVisits operation works. Certain utility classes have been omitted for readability.
![DeleteVisitsSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteVisitsSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `deleteVisits d/Date` command.
![DeleteVisitsActivityDiagram](images/DeleteVisitsActivityDiagram.png)
#### Design consideration

The design considerations below highlight alternative ways to delete Visits from the visit list

##### Aspect: Deleting visits using person and location vs using date

* **Alternative 1:** User delete Visits using a specific person or location.
  * All the visit records involving the specific person or the location will be deleted 

* **Alternative 2:** User delete Visits using a specific date.
  * All the visit records before and up to the date will be deleted 
  
For this aspect, we choose to use the second alternative using the specific date 

**Rationale**

The use of the visit records data is to assist contact tracing if an infected case is reported and the relevant information
such as the list of potential infected and infected places could then be generated by comparing the visits records of the infected with
other people's visit record. However, as the infected patients are only able to transmit the virus within a certain time frame,
e.g. two weeks or more, the visit records in the far past may not be helpful for generating the useful information.

Deleting by date allows the user to easily get rid of the outdated visit records data. In comparison, deleting by person and location serve
less of such purposes. It is only helpful when the location or the person information turns out to be invalid and hence
need to be removed. This implementation can be merged into the execution of deleting location or deleting person command.
Also, deleting by location and person tend to be much slower compared to using dates, especially when the number of people 
and locations are large.

### Manage data using CSV files (Siang Ern)

Most data collected by the target user group are likely to be in the form of Excel documents. As such, it is necessary for VirusTracker to include features to import and export data in a way that is compatible with Excel.

The features are facilitated by the `addFromCsv` and `exportToCsv` commands. They allow VirusTracker to manage data using **Comma-separated values** files which could also be handled by Excel.

#### Importing data from a CSV file

This feature essentially acts as a "bulk add" operation. The number of rows in the CSV file corresponds to the **maximum** number of objects that could be added to VirusTracker.

**Format:** `addFromCsv FILEPATH l/LIST_TYPE`

* `FILEPATH` refers to the absolute path that the file would be located at.
* `LIST_TYPE` is the data type that the user is attempting to add. The `addFromCsv` command supports three list types:
    1. [people](#add-person)
    2. [locations](#add-location)
    3. [visits](#add-visit)
* Each row in the specified CSV file must follow the format for the add command of the respective type. To find out about the format, you may click the relevant list type above.

An example of a CSV file that is used to add people is shown below. Notice that column G is not completely filled as the field is optional.

![SamplePersonCsv](images/ExamplePersonCsv.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The number of columns in the CSV file should correspond to the number of parameters required to create the related object. Information on additional columns **will be disregarded**.

</div>

#### Sequence diagram

The sequence diagram below shows how the adding operation works. Certain utility classes have been omitted for readability.

![AddFromCsvCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddFromCsvSequenceDiagram.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The above sequence diagram uses the `AddPersonsFromCsvCommand` to handle adding people from CSV files. For locations and visits, replace the command with `AddLocationsFromCsvCommand` and
`AddVisitsFromCsvCommand` respectively. The behaviour of the three commands are the same as the above sequence diagram.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Lifelines should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `addFromCsv` command.

![AddFromCsvActivityDiagram](images/AddFromCsvActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations:

The design considerations below highlight alternative ways the command could have been implemented, and provides reasons for the choice of implementation.

##### Aspect: How are exceptions handled

For this aspect, we make a distinction between fatal exceptions and non-fatal exceptions.

* Fatal exceptions
  * Exceptions that cause the command to be unable to execute further.
  * These exceptions include but are not limited to: _missing parameters in CSV file_, _invalid file path, etc._    

* Non-fatal exceptions
  * The command could still continue executing even if this exception occured.
  * For example, _duplicate objects in the CSV file._
  * They tend to occur on a row by row basis in the CSV file.
  
* **Alternative 1:** Stop execution of command only for destructive exceptions.
  * Pros: User does not need to rerun the command for every exception that occurs.
  * Cons: Allowing certain exceptions to pass through may result in some bugs further down the line.

* **Alternative 2:** Stop execution for every exception that occurs.
  * Pros: Ensures correctness of the added objects.
  * Cons: May lead to worse user experience having to constantly rerun the command.
  
**Implementation**
 
Alternative 1 was chosen as the implementation with considerations from alternative 2.
* Upon encountering:
  * Fatal exception
    * The command stops execution and informs the user of the error.
  * Non-fatal exception
    * The command continues executing.
    * The rows where the exception occurs are recorded.
    * Upon finishing execution, the user is informed of the success and notified of the erroneous rows.
    
**Rationale**

As this command handles data from CSV files, it is likely the CSV files would be large (containing more than 10,000 rows).
  * Time taken for the `addFromCsv` command to execute is significant.
  
As such, the above implementation helps to reduce the need to read the large file repeatedly. 
  * User can fix the erroneous rows on a new CSV file.
  * Execution of the command would be faster than if the same large file was executed again.

This would minimise the impact to user experience as the user would spend less time fixing the errors.

##### Aspect: Absolute file path

The file path the command uses is the absolute path.
* The absolute path provides the complete details to locate the CSV file.
* Helps to avoid navigation errors that may result from using relative path names.

By allowing the user to specify the path name, it also gives the user a choice on where to put his CSV files instead of enforcing a particular directory for
him to store the files.

##### Aspect: Reusing list types and the list prefix 'l/'

**Concern**: The list types are used for the `list` command, which appear to be unrelated to the `addFromCsv` command.

**Rationale**

This command handles people, locations and visits which corresponded to the list types already implemented for use for the list command.

By using a format similar to the `list` command, it avoids the need for implementing a possible **data type** parameter which would not have a
significant difference from list type.

Furthermore, it allows the user to use a format that they are already comfortable with.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### List high risk locations of infection
This feature allows the VirusTracker to display a list high risk location of infection. This list of high risk location 
of infection is generated using data currently stored in VirusTracker. The data include the infection status of all 
people, all visits that are made by infected people and all locations. 

**Format:** `list l/high-risk-locations`

#### Implementation
This feature is one of the different `list` commands. It has the same command word as other `list` commands, which is 
`list`. The `LIST_TYPE` of this command is `high-risk-location`.

* Infected person is defined as person with infection status as `true`
* Infected visit is defined as visit made by any infected person
* Infected location is defined as location that has been visited by any infected person
* Number of high risk location of infection is defined as:    
    * If number of infected location is larger than 60% of number of total number of location, then the number of high risk 
location is `40% * (number of total locations)`.  
    * Else, number of high risk location is the number of infected location. 

1. When this command is executed, a list of all infected people is obtained.
2. A list of all visits made by all infected people is obtained using the list of infected people.
3. Use a `HashMap` to store the location as the key and the number of visits made by any infected person to this 
location as the value. Generate this `HashMap` from the list of visits in step 2.
4. Sort the `HashMap` in Step 3 from most infected visits to least infected visits.
5. Calculate the number of high risk locaiton `n`, using number of infected location and number of total location.
6. Display the top `n` locations of the sorted infected location list as the list of high risk locations.

#### Sequence diagram
The sequence diagram below shows how the list operation works. Certain utility classes have been omitted for readability.
![ListHighRiskLocationSequenceDiagram](images/ListHighRiskLocationSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `list l/high-risk-locations` command.
![ListHighRiskLocationActivityDiagram](images/ListHighRiskLocationActivityDiagram.png)
#### Design consideration
##### Aspect: Definition of number of high risk location of infection
When displaying the list of high risk location of infection, the top few locations that has been most visited by any 
infected people are wanted. 

If number of infected location is larger than 60% of number of total number of location, then the number of high risk 
location is `40% * (number of total locations)`.  The number `40%` is an appropriate number as not too many nor too few
infected locations will be displayed.

Else, number of high risk location is the number of infected location. Since less than 40% of total locations are 
infected, all infected locations can be considered as high risk because they are the only few locations that are infected.

### GUI Functionality for displaying lists of people, locations and visits (Koh Han Ming)
VirusTracker manages lists of person, location and visit objects. Accordingly, it needs to be able to display the information stored in these objects in a meaningful way. As the lists can be updated, the information displayed must also be changed.
These changes will be reflected on the GUI every time a list is updated. The lists are updated when the user inputs one of the following commands:

1. Adding data: `add`
2. Deleting data: `delete`
3. Editing data: `edit`
4. Finding data: `find`
5. Listing data: `list`
6. Generating people in contact with an infected person: `generatePeople`
7. Generating locations an infected person has been to: `generateLocations`

#### Sequence diagram
The sequence diagram below shows how the GUI updates using the list all people command as an example: `list l/people`
![DisplayListOfAllPeopleSequenceDiagram](images/DisplayListOfAllPeopleSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Activity diagram

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
